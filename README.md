# QuotaScope

QuotaScope is a local-first dashboard for inspecting Codex usage from local session logs. It shows token trends, quota status, session rankings, model rankings, request distribution, cache hit rate, and rate-limit risk.

The dashboard is a static HTML app. Your real usage export stays local in `data.js`, which is intentionally ignored by git.

## Features

- Token usage trend with absolute and logarithmic scales
- Hourly/cumulative trend modes
- Date filters: last 24 hours, today, last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range
- Request and token distribution charts
- Real Codex quota status from local `rate_limits` events when available
- Session and model rankings
- Local-only data generation from `~/.codex/sessions`

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` directly in a browser to view the bundled sample data.

To view your own local Codex usage:

```bash
python3 generate_codex_data.py
open index.html
```

The generator writes `data.js` next to `index.html`. That file may contain private project names, session ids, timestamps, usage patterns, and quota status, so it is excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Verify Layout

The responsive visual audit uses Playwright:

```bash
npm install
npm run verify
```

## Privacy

QuotaScope does not send data to a server. `generate_codex_data.py` reads local Codex session logs and exports only usage metadata:

- session id and working-directory basename
- model name
- token counts
- rate limit metadata
- task duration, first-token latency, failures

It does not export prompt text, assistant messages, tool output, or file contents.

Review `data.js` before sharing screenshots or artifacts generated from your own usage.
